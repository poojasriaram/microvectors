By combining intent intelligence, behavioral signals, market sensing, and predictive analytics, the engine transforms scattered data into a continuous stream of actionable demand insights. It enables enterprises to move from reactive lead generation to proactive demand creation, aligning sales, marketing, and product teams around high-confidence revenue opportunities.",
